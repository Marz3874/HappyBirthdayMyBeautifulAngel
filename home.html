                HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my beautiful babygirl, i hope so far your day has gone good. This will be the second birthday we spend together as a couple and the third I’ve had the 
                pleasure of being apart of. For your last three birthdays I’ve gotten you a variety of gifts, I wanted to switch things up a little and give you something one of a kind. Now let me
                remind you how special you are to me…Since the moment I first laid eyes on you in ceramics class I knew I had to be your friend. Something about you was so different from all
                the others in that class, the energy you radiated was so strong. I think the energy was my future self hinting to me that you would be the most amazing thing to ever happen to me.
                However at the time I just thought you were really cool and I never really thought I had a shot at being your friend, we met after covid time which is were I went from being super
                social and annoying to being really quiet and reserved. Idk if you noticed
                or not but ceramics class is where I grew out of that. Anyway back to you, the first two things I noticed about you was the way you dressed so nice to school everyday and your
                long beautiful hair. It was the way your curtain bangs fell, with those beautiful blue eyes and that beautiful skin tone of yours. I noticed these things about you as I sat
                across/next to you everyday, before I even realized what had happened, it happened, I looked forward to talking to you every morning even as just my friend and i started walking to
                your house in the mornings to spend time with you. Our love story is my favorite, it was purely accidental, it was fate. When we first started talking i was terrified, i had never met anyone like you
                before and i was scared to fuck it all up. I knew that i didnt just have to charm you but i had to prove myself worthy of entering into your life. Even throughout our talking stage
                i still felt like there was still best friend energy there, but it was that night at katherines that truly changed everything for me. I couldnt sleep becuase i didnt want it to end,
                thats when i realized i wanted nothing more then to hold you forever. Your arms had felt like a comfort i never knew was possible it felt as if my soul had spent years looking for
                you. From that moment on nothing was the same, and before i realized it i was starring at your beautiful skin in the sunlight, before i realized it... i was falling asleep to the thought
                of you and waking up with you on my mind. My point here is falling in love with you was easy, but i didnt just fall, i grew more in love with you everday we spent together. Aug 26th i 
                asked you to be mine and you said yes, who wouldve known we would be getting married next month. The begining of a relationship is usually everyones favorite, it is the true definition
                of the honeymoon stage where nothing can go wrong. I loved our honeymoon stage but the reality of it is i love where we are now, we are the true definition of love, despite ever obsticle
                we've endured we're still here baby and nothing in life is a couincidance. You've shown me that i can be loved and i hope to have shown you the same becuase no matter how much or what
                we argue about i love you more and more everyday. I cant think of a greater blessing in life then being able to love you and be loved by you, you bring me to my knees angel, i would do 
                whatever you ask whenever you ask it of me. I am so irrecovably in love with everything about you. There is a famous poem by the author Edgar Allan Poe that reads:

            <div class="poem">
            <p>
                                                                                "And Neither the Heavens above
                                                                                <br>
                                                                                    Nor the demons down under the sea
                                                                                <br>

                                                                                <br>

                                                                                    dreams
                                                                                <br>

                The author talks about a girl he knew years ago in a "kingdom by the sea" and although they were just children they were undoubtedly in love. The poem talks of her death, 
                however the poem emphisizes that true love never dies. You are my Annabel Lee angel. I know many people look at us and probably think " theyre too young to know anything
                about love." but the truth is i know our love is strong, and i will love you for the rest of our lives and after that aswell. Our souls will follow eachother to every 
                timeline, every universe, every life, because not even death can dissever my soul from yours. Your love for me makes me feel as though i were living in a movie, the way
                your caress your fingers through my hair, they way your pupils dialate when they meet mine, the engery that transfers from my soul to your everytime you touch me. its your 
                love that makes me wake up wanting to be a better version of myself. You and your beautiful soul. I know how lucky i am to have the privilage of experiancing your love, 
                today and on this vacation we celebrate you birth baby; because i dont know what i would do if i had never met you. I hope that ive made your time on this earth enjoyable
                so far and i only hope to make it ever more so as the years go on. I promise that i will work as hard as i can to provide you with a life that will fulfill your heart in every
                way, and in things i cant fulfill i wish to do nothing but support you and help you persue every goal you have for yourself. Its me and you against the world baby. I love you 
                more than everything and anything my beautiful birthday girl.
